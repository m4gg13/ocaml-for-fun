(* list meditations *)


(* sometimes things fit into a group. *)
(* lists are groups that can be adjusted. *)

(* there are tuple lists... *)

(* since lists can be adjusted, there are ways to adjust lists. *)

(* adding one element to the front of a list is called concatenation. *)
let add2front =

(* adding a list to the front of another list can be done through appending. *)
let addls2ls =

(* it is possible to put structures with names into other structures as well. *)
let all2gether =
  (ingredient, recipe, spices)

(* notice that among all of this adjusting, the original structures are never /changed/. new structures are created, but never the old ones changed. *)
