(* conditional meditations *)


(* since there exists an essential principle of truth and falsehood in the universe, we can base events off of the truth or falsehood (the logical state) of a statement. *)

(* the events that will occur in either case are defined within a conditional statement. *)
let cardsinadeck =
  52

let cardscollected =
  47

(* 
let fair =
  if cardsinadeck == cardscollected 
  then "you found all of the cards!" 
  else "some cards are still missing."

(* sometimes you'd simply like to express whether or not something is true. *)
let hearts =
  12
let diamonds =
  10
let clubs =
  13
let spades =
  12

let haveallhearts =
  if hearts == 12
  then "all hearts are present"
  else "you're missing some!"
